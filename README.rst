GPCAL
===================

GPCAL is a Python module for instrumental polarization calibration in VLBI data. Its design aims to improve calibration accuracy by enabling users to simultaneously fit the model to data from multiple calibrators and incorporate the linear polarization structures of these calibrators, rather than relying on the conventional similarity assumption.

Installation
------------
GPCAL is based on AIPS and uses ParselTongue, a Python interface to AIPS (`Kettenis et al. 2006 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ASPC..351..497K>`_), to run AIPS tasks. ParselTongue can be easily installed by following the instructions `here <https://www.jive.eu/jivewiki/doku.php?id=parseltongue:parseltongue>`_.

GPCAL is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/gpcal/>`_ and can be installed via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gpcal

It should install most of the required libraries automatically (`astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `pandas <http://www.pandas.pydata.org/>`_ , `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org/>`_,  `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_).

Note that ParselTongue is based on Python 2. One of the easiest ways to avoid any conflicts in Python versions among different softwares is to create a new Anaconda environment for Python 2 and install ParselTongue there.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n myenv python=2.7
    conda activate myenv
    conda install -c kettenis parseltongue

Try to run ParselTongue in the environment and import gpcal.

Note: Python 2 is not supported on Macs with M1 or later chips running macOS versions higher than 12.3. Consequently, using GPCAL on the latest Mac systems can be challenging. Although we attempted to transition to Python 3, a critical bug in some key functions of ParselTongue3 has not been resolved by the developer. For Mac users who still wish to install GPCAL, a workaround method is available `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVV6uuZXVAMGbBygtg7JBudkeF1HOBFeUQMYipeDzrE/edit?usp=sharing>`_, which has been tested successfully on M1/OS 14.2.1 and M3/OS 14.6.1.

Tutorial
-------------
There are example data and scripts in the "examples" folder. Tutorial slides using one of those data can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Rhb2WOrtrEJIjXL83XM0uWXQ3YVmkc_F8tVfLpJuK8/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
